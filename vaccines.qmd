## Vaccines

### Animal Vaccines

At the present, only one vaccine has been conditionally approved for use in poultry in the United States [@Cohen_2025].
The vaccine is produced by [Zoetis](https://news.zoetis.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Zoetis-Receives-Conditional-License-from-USDA-for-Avian-Influenza-Vaccine-H5N2-Subtype-Killed-Virus/default.aspx) and it contains a killed version of the H5N2 variant of the influenza virus.

## Therapeutics

Therapeutics for viral infections are generally used after an infection occurs.
We know that the human or the the animal host has been infected, and we can use therapeutics such as antivirals or monoclonal antibodies to treat the infection and reduce the severity of the disease (i.e., duration of illness, mortality, etc.).

### Antivirals

There are currently [four FDA approved antivirals](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/antiviral-drugs.html) for the treatment of influenza in humans.

- oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu)
- zanamivir
- peramivir
- baloxavir

Antivirals interfere with the ability of the virus to replicate in the infected individual.
For example oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor. The flu's neuraminidase enzyme is responsible for cleaving the sugar molecules (sialic acid) that form the backbone of the viral envelope, and instead of binding to the sialic acid, oseltamivir binds to the enzyme and inhibits its activity.
Antiviral are not without risk as some carry side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache.
Additionally, antivirals add selective pressure to the virus population in the host which can lead to the emergence of antivirual resistant viruses which can be transmitted to other hosts and make antiviruals less effective.
This has been seen sporadically with H5N1 [@McKimmBreschkin_2013].

### Monoclonal Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that are produced in pharamaceutical laboratories rather than being produced by the host's immune system.
They are designed to target a specific antigen and are used to treat a variety of diseases including cancer and viral infections.
Unfortunately, no licensed monoclonal antibodies have been approved for the treatment of influenza--though there are groups actively working on developing them [@Lederhofer_Tsybovsky_Nguyen_Raab_Creanga_Stephens_Gillespie_Syeda_Fisher_Skertic_et].
This is due to a multitude of reasons, mainly that the influenza virus is constant under going changes through mutation, recombination, and antigenic drift.
