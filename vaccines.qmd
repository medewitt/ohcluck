## Vaccines

### Animal Vaccines

At the present, only one vaccine has been conditionally approved for use in poultry in the United States [@Cohen_2025].
The vaccine is produced by [Zoetis](https://news.zoetis.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Zoetis-Receives-Conditional-License-from-USDA-for-Avian-Influenza-Vaccine-H5N2-Subtype-Killed-Virus/default.aspx) and it contains a killed version of the H5N2 variant of the influenza virus.

## Therapeutics

Therapeutics for viral infections are generally used after an infection occurs.
We know that the human or the the animal host has been infected, and we can use therapeutics such as antivirals or monoclonal antibodies to treat the infection and reduce the severity of the disease (i.e., duration of illness, mortality, etc.).

### Antivirals

### Monoclonal Antibodies
